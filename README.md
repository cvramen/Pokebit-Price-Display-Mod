# Pokebit-Price-Display-Mod
A tool that accesses Bitcoin US Dollar exchange rate data with JSON and modifies numbers on a page to provide information on equivalent values of products priced in Bitcoin

This is JavaScript that appears in the pages of the online Pok√©mon card store I run, PokeBit. This helps the customer better understand the price of the product by allowing them to see a price in both Bitcoin (which is what they are paying with) and the equivalent in US Dollars.
